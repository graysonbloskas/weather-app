# weather-app
## About
I was tasked with creating a website that calls a weather API; the site is for travelers who want to check the current weather of a particular city, as well as a five day forecast. They want to see the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. 

## More Detail
Once the user inputs a city, their search is saved on local storage. The storage is appended to the page in the form of a button, so that the user can toggle past city searches. 

## NOT COMPLETE
This website is not complete. I need to come back and update the application so that forecast is displayed, the moment() time is displayed, and to clean up the UI/css.
